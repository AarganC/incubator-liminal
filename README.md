# Rainbow

Rainbow is an end-to-end platform for data engineers & scientists, allowing them to build,
train and deploy machine learning models in a robust and agile way.

The platform provides the abstractions and declarative capabilities for
data extraction & feature engineering followed by model training and serving.
Rainbow's goal is to operationalize the machine learning process, allowing data scientists to
quickly transition from a successful experiment to an automated pipeline of model training,
validation, deployment and inference in production, freeing them from engineering and
non-functional tasks, and allowing them to focus on machine learning code and artifacts.

# Basics

Using simple YAML configuration, create your own schedule data pipelines (a sequence of tasks to
perform), application servers,  and more.

## Example YAML config file
```yaml
name: MyPipeline
owner: Bosco Albert Baracus

  - pipeline: my_pipeline

     backends: [ 'cloudwatch' ]
    tasks:
      - task: my_static_input_task
        type: python
        description: static input task
        image: my_static_input_task_image
        source: helloworld
        env_vars:
          env1: "a"
          env2: "b"
        input_type: static
        input_path: '[ { "foo": "bar" }, { "foo": "baz" } ]'
        output_path: /output.json
        cmd: python -u hello_world.py
